## Networking Foundation 
####  ‚úÖ LAN 
Local Area Network example office, home 
#### ‚úÖ WAN 
Wire Area Network
#### ‚úÖ Eternet 
COPPER CABLE, FIBER OPTIC CONNECTION 
##### UTP CABLES ( not support > 100 meters ) Router, PC, Firewall - transmit pins at 1&2 layer - receive pins at 3&6 layer ; Switch - transmit pins at 3&6 layer - receive pins at 1&2 layer
##### Mutimode fiber : chepaer, longer than UTP 
##### Singlemode fiber : more expensrive, support longer than > 150 meters 
Collection of network protocol/standard 
#### Switch : connect the same network
#### Router : connect network with another network 
#### Firewall üî• üöß : 
## Network Devices
#### Host : any devices send and reseive traffic such as iphone, computer, server, taptop, printers, could server , TV, refrigerator, lights, speakers
Host 2 type : 1. client is a initiate request,  or 2. server is respond
#### Network 
Network is transports traffics between hosts, network can also contain another networks sometime called Sup network or Subnet. 

#### IP address = 32 bits (32 of 1 and 0 ) devices to four octets and convert into desimal numbers : 0-255
IP address is the identity of each host, every hosts to have Ip Address for communication with each other
#### Repreater 
Repreester is regenerater signals, allow communicater to a greater distance, 
#### Bridge 
Only have 2 ports, learn which host are be one each side. 
#### Hub : Multi port repeaters.
Hub will send all the packets to all the hosts. Everybody will receive all everyone else data. 
#### Switch
Multi port, learn which host on each port
#### Router 

## OSI Model Layers ( Open System Interconnectioin )
#### Function are divided in 7 layers 
###### Application : Closer to the usuer (www. https,Chrome, Brave )
###### Presentation : Application format, translate between Applications and Network formats ex. Encryption of data as it is sent and Encryption of data as it  is received, Sum up : transalte data to appropriately formats.
