# Hello I am a 💻 🐝 🦺 
## Networking Foundation 
####  ✅ LAN 
Local Area Network example office, home 
#### ✅ WAN 
Wire Area Network
#### ✅ Eternet 
COPPER CABLE, FIBER OPTIC CONNECTION 
##### UTP CABLES ( not support > 100 meters ) Router, PC, Firewall - transmit pins at 1&2 layer - receive pins at 3&6 layer ; Switch - transmit pins at 3&6 layer - receive pins at 1&2 layer
##### Mutimode fiber : chepaer, longer than UTP 
##### Singlemode fiber : more expensrive, support longer than > 150 meters 
## ♦️ Network Devices
#### ♦️ Host : any devices send and reseive traffic such as iphone, computer, server, taptop, printers, could server , TV, refrigerator, lights, speakers
Host 2 type : 1. client is a initiate request,  or 2. server is respond
#### ♦️ Network 
Network is transports traffics between hosts, network can also contain another networks sometime called Sup network or Subnet. 
#### ♦️ IP address = 32 bits (32 of 1 and 0 ) devices to four octets and convert into desimal numbers : 0-255
IP address is the identity of each host, every hosts to have Ip Address for communication with each other
#### ♦️ Repreater 
Repreester is regenerater signals, allow communicater to a greater distance, 
#### ♦️ Bridge 
Only have 2 ports, learn which host are be one each side. 
#### ♦️ Hub : Multi port repeaters.
Hub will send all the packets to all the hosts. Everybody will receive all everyone else data. 
#### ♦️ Switch
Multi port, learn which host on each port, facilitate within a network
#### ♦️ Router 
Faciloitate communication between networks

## OSI Model Layers ( Open System Interconnectioin )
#### Function are divided in 7 layers 
###### 🎩 Application : Closer to the usuer (www. https,Chrome, Brave )
###### 🎩 Presentation : Application format, translate between Applications and Network formats ex. Encryption of data as it is sent and Encryption of data as it  is received, Sum up : transalte data to appropriately formats.  
###### 🎩 Seccion
###### 🎩 Transportation
###### 🎩 Network
###### 🎩 Data Link
###### 🎩 Physical  🖥️ 
## Protocols : A set of rule and message that form an internet standard.
#### ⭐️ ARP : Address Resolution Protocol 
Reslove IP to MAC mapping, ARP Requests / ARP Response 
#### ⭐️ FTP  : File Transfer Protocol
RETR file.pdf (Allow the client and server send and request files)
#### ⭐️ SMTP : Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
#### ⭐️ HTTP : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 
Communicate with a web server
#### ⭐️ SSL : Security Sockets Protocol
#### ⭐️ TLS : Transport Layer Protocol
#### ⭐️ HTTPS : HTTP + SSL/TLS 
## Every host need four item for intenet connectivity 
#### 💫 1. IP address = Host's identity of the internet 
#### 💫 2. Subnet mask = Size of host's network 
#### 💫 3. Default Gateway = Router's IP address 
#### 💫 4. DNS server IPs = Transalte domain name to IPs 
## ℹ️ How SSL/TLS protect your data? 
### To protect the data in three way 
#### Confidential : only Access client and server : Encryption 
#### Integrity : can not be modified between client and server : Hashing, Singature 
#### Authentication : Client and server are indeeded who they think they are ( you know exactly who you speaking with ) : PKI, Singature
